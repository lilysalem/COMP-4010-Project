### Group 17 progress report - 30 Oct 2025

Over the past 2 weeks, we've started our experiments with agent training and are getting ready to start gathering data
and writing our report.

#### Progress made in the last 2 weeks:

Over the past 2 weeks, we achieved the following:

- Adapted our existing environment/agents to start training in our environment.
- Built our working reset function, which was missing in our previous demonstration. 
- Finalized our state space and the "viewable" state for ant agents
- Started our final report's outline and structure


#### Plans in the next 2 weeks:

In the next 2 weeks, we plan to:

- Fully implement q-learning and dyna-q with our agents
- Create a "test bench" to gather data on how our agents behave on different hyperparameters
- Organize gathered data and build visualizations
- Write our report and merge the final code versions we want to main
