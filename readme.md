#### Getting Started:

- This project uses Python 3.12. It is best to set up a virtual environment in the repo before proceeding, especially
  on MacOS or Linux distros
    - More on how to set up a python venv [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Use ```$pip install -r ./requirements.txt``` while inside the repo folder to install requirements.
- Current environment demo is done through running ```python3 ./src/hex_grid_world.py```
    - Testing will be migrated to ./testbed.py in the future
